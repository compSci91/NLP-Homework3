Note to Wenlin Yao

The code has been compiled for your convenience. Per feedback you gave me on Homework 1, I've endeavored to make the run optinos look as similiar to Python as possible. 

To run this code, place grammar_rules.txt and sents.txt in the same directory. 

Then, simply run java Main grammar_rules.text sents.txt.
